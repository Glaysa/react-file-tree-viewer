### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I wanted to learn more about react and so followed a tutorial on YouTube and built this simple file tree viewer.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
